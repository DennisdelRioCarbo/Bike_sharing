## Summary: 
* Most rides are carried out by subscribers.
* Rides are under an hour in duration.
* Riding is carried out in a relative small area of the city which is also explained by the short duration of each rides.
* The highest number of users are male.
* The days of the week and times of the day with most rides are as follow:
  - From Monday to Friday between 8:00 am to 10:00 am.
  - From Monday to Friday between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.
  - Saturdays and Sundays between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm.
* Usage seems more steady during the weekend whereas weekdays see more peak hour usage.
This suggest that during the weekday people use the bike to commute to and from work and maybe run some errands after work. Weekend usage could suggest more recreational users or non subscribers.

* Additional visualizations would be needed to establish the relationship between type of user and trip by weekday by hour to determine if subscribers use the bike during weekdays and customers use them more during the weekend.
