## Summary: 
* Around 81% of  rides are carried out by subscribers. 
* Most rides are under an hour in duration with the majority of them being between 1 and 21 minutes.
* Riding is carried out in a relative small area of the city which is also explained by the short duration of each ride.
* The highest number of users are male.
* The days of the week and times of the day with most rides are as follow:
  - From Monday to Friday between 8:00 am to 10:00 am.
  - From Monday to Friday between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.
  - Saturdays and Sundays between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm.
* Usage seems more steady during the weekend whereas weekdays see more peak hour usage.
This suggest that during the weekday people use the bike to commute to and from work and maybe run some errands after work. Weekend usage could mean more recreational riding. 
* The fact that around 80% of riders are subscribers could mean that there is steady revenue for the company.
* More visualizations would be needed to establish the relationship between age and ridership and type of customer by age and also between age and gender.
* More data and further analysis would be needed to determine why most rides are carried out by males which also presents a business opportunity if we could get more female riders to ride or subscribe more to the service.
